So you want to add pages, 
well first lets understand the file structure.
Every webserver will have a few files and folders
^fE^bF DO NOT EDIT ANY FILE EXCEPT THOSE FOUND IN "SITE/"
so if you wanted to edit the home page you do:
edit site/home
adding a page tho requires a few more steps:
edit site/PAGE, but you'll notice that it saves:
PAGE.lua dynet cant use this so,
rename site/PAGE.lua site/PAGEE, and perfect
^f7I recommend you use pastebin or github 
^f7to edit and install webpages,
^f7example using github:
^fBwget LINK site/PAGE
^b0^fE [Prev Page] ~loc:create2
^b0^fE [Next Page] ~loc:create4
