So you want to add pages, 
well first lets understand the file structure.
Every webserver will have a few files and folders
^fE^bF DO NOT TOUCH OR EDIT ANY FILE EXCEPT THOSE FOUND IN "SITE/"
so if you wanted to edit the home page you will do:
edit site/home
pretty simple, adding a page tho requires a few more steps:
edit site/PAGE, but you'll notice that it will be saved as
PAGE.lua we do not want this so do:
rename site/PAGE.lua site/PAGEE, and perfect
you now have another page called PAGEE.
I recommend you use pastebin or github to edit and install webpages,
example using github:
wget LINK site/PAGE
^b0^fE [Prev Page] ~loc:create2
^b0^fE [Next Page] ~loc:create4
